# Network Labs

Hands-on home lab for virtualization, basic network recon, and documentation.  
This repo supports the roadmap in **cyber-portfolio-roadmap** and will feed evidence/screenshots into future blue-team and red-team labs.

## Goals
- Build reproducible **Kali** and **Windows** VMs (snapshotted, hardened basics)
- Practice **host discovery** and **service enumeration** (Nmap)
- Capture screenshots, command logs, and keep clean write-ups

## Milestones
- [ ] Create/snapshot Kali VM
- [ ] Create/snapshot Windows VM
- [ ] Run Nmap host discovery on lab network
- [ ] Document results with screenshots and notes
- [ ] Link findings back to roadmap issues

## Safety
This lab is isolated. Only **legally owned/authorized** systems are scanned.
